<h2>Tip 1

Have him around 100k hp when lightening spawns. If his hp is higher you need to do decent dmg during the lightening (making it more distracting)<br>
If you're not hitting 100k-110k at lightening, you're dps is slightly off. I think in the vid my lightenings are 80k, 130k and 80k <br>
on the 130k (p2) you'll notice i have to do a lot of shit during the lightenings which makes them a bit messier/more hectic <br><br>
Tip 2:<br>
At the end of P1, if you timeskip immediately as it's available, you have enough time to:<br>
Timeskip > sun (1 tick later, not same tick) > gcon > dbreath >[LIMITLESS] + 4t wild magic > [DUAL WIELD] Asphyx<br>
Right as the 3rd hit of Asphyx goes off, you activate D Breath at the same time, and walk under him as you cast it<br>
<br>
If you're 1 tick late on any of this, you can only afford to let Asphyx hit twice<br>
Reason for Asphyx with dual wield means your dbreath is also with dual wield, means you can 4tick wild magic after you've walked under him <br>
<br>
Tip 3 (part 1):<br>
You can see it form the vid but the process is:<br>
- Click north min > vit pot > click south min > run to halfway point between north n west<br>
- timeskip > sun (1 tick later) > vuln bomb + gcon > dbreath > 4t wild magic > asphyx<br>
- allow asphyx to hit 4 times even tho timeskip has put you back to full adr etc.<br>
- while apshyx is hitting, do eee + food/brew/blubber to full hp<br>
- when asphyx has ended, do g staff > gconc > dbreath (it should die, if not, gchain, impact etc)<br>
<br>
then <br>
- vuln bomb + g staff north clone > wild magic > 4t asphyx<br>
- ur gonna notice ur hp starts dropping a lot here, maintain it with brew/blubber. don't eat too high cos ur gonna adapt ur last clones HP soon anyway.<br>
- 4tick it down with basics (g conc/db/gchain/gconc) <br><br>
Tip 3 (part 2):<br>
then<br>
- take over your last clone, immediately reflect with defender + eat to full<br>
- if your adren is 70%+, try to get to 100% and do a time skip > sunshine between kerapac and last clone<br>
- if you get the skip+sun then do 2 abilities > limitless + devotion > wild magic > wild magic again > gconc > db<br>
- devotion when your first one runs out, get the extension off the clone if it's still alive, then fight kerapac<br>
- if you didnt get skip+sun cos adren too low, fuck the sun, do a bunch of damage to the clone, then timeskip + devotion <br>
- try to finish the minion on that devotion to get the extend, if not just reapply devotion after the timeskip and get your extension off that one<br>
<br>
then<br>
- for kerapac, 3-4 key abilities: debilitate + reflect + preparation + resonance<br>
- i like to use some big abilities while my devotion is still up, then right after devotion i do spellbook swap + disrup shield<br>
- then debilitate and keep dpsing<br>
- grab a resonance on soul split after debilitate ends, then preparation to get resonance back faster<br>
- then defender + reflect. By the time reflect runs out, debilitate should be back up<br>
- by the time debilitate runs out, resonance should be back up<br>
- by the time you've lost HP again, you should be close to timeskip devotion again<br>
<br>
i normally only need 1 debilitate and 1 resonance, but i do a shit load of soul split flicking which helps <br>
Random tips:<br>

- i like to try and keep him in 1 place during jumps incase Wen book procs, except for jump 3 when i prioritise Combust instead (cant do it earlier as sun is up)<br>
- there's about 3-4 different lightening patterns to get used to. Typically you can always eliminate 2 with a bd+surge, then surge the last one. sometimes you can get all 3 with 1 BD+surge<br>
- always vuln bomb + smoke cloud during the end of p1/2, before time skip<br>
- the end of p2, you wanna activate timeskip + sun much earlier than the end of p1, allowing you to get the full 4-hit asphyx in the timeskip (instead of 3 + move). Timed perfectly, you can even get a gconc+wild magic as you run under him (i did it in the vid) <br>
- play with voiceover sounds on, sun + vuln bomb + target cycle when he says 'you' at the start for perfect start everytime<br>
- generally every sunshine should include:<br>

- wild magic (in skip)<br>
- asphyx (in skip)<br>
- wild magic<br>
- asphyx<br>
- 4t deto+dbreath<br>
- gstaff<br>
- 60% omnipower<br>

sun should be ending 4-5sec after the omnipower, and omnipower should be happening around the start of jumps.<br>
make sure you run back in your sun afte ra jump if it still has 4-5 seconds left.<br>
<br>
When you say in the vid i dont take much dmg p4...<br>
I have a small EnhDev4 carry<br>
it procs:<br>
first clone<br>
second clone<br>
third clone (right as i skip+sun, which hleps a lot)<br>
third clone again<br>
third clone again (b2b) though both of these are irrelevent cos im in skip, so HP doesnt matter as it'll revert back to full anyway<br>
third clone again (as i come out of skip), irrelevent cos im in devotion<br>
kerapac, but irrelevent cos im in devotion<br>
kerapac while im at 40% hp, which is huge cos i will heal myself back to 60% before i take dmg again<br>
<br>
so during p4, i get:<br>
- 20 seconds of irrelevent damage (cos im in timeskip, so i heal anyway)<br>
- about 2k hp of free healing when i take over my last clone<br>
- about 13-14 seconds of relevent devotion<br>
- 1 disruption shield, which is huge cos he attacks every 2.4 seconds, so if you time it right you get around 4 seconds of free soul split<br>
- 8 seconds of deblitate, though in the vid i only get 7 because i used it inbetween his attacks, rather than right as one landed<h2>
