<p>Tip 1

Have him around 100k hp when lightening spawns. If his hp is higher you need to do decent dmg during the lightening (making it more distracting)
If you're not hitting 100k-110k at lightening, you're dps is slightly off. I think in the vid my lightenings are 80k, 130k and 80k
on the 130k (p2) you'll notice i have to do a lot of shit during the lightenings which makes them a bit messier/more hectiv 
Tip 2:
At the end of P1, if you timeskip immediately as it's available, you have enough time to:
Timeskip > sun (1 tick later, not same tick) > gcon > dbreath >[LIMITLESS] + 4t wild magic > [DUAL WIELD] Asphyx
Right as the 3rd hit of Asphyx goes off, you activate D Breath at the same time, and walk under him as you cast it

If you're 1 tick late on any of this, you can only afford to let Asphyx hit twice
Reason for Asphyx with dual wield means your dbreath is also with dual wield, means you can 4tick wild magic after you've walked under him

Tip 3 (part 1):
You can see it form the vid but the process is:
- Click north min > vit pot > click south min > run to halfway point between north n west
- timeskip > sun (1 tick later) > vuln bomb + gcon > dbreath > 4t wild magic > asphyx
- allow asphyx to hit 4 times even tho timeskip has put you back to full adr etc.
- while apshyx is hitting, do eee + food/brew/blubber to full hp
- when asphyx has ended, do g staff > gconc > dbreath (it should die, if not, gchain, impact etc)

then 
- vuln bomb + g staff north clone > wild magic > 4t asphyx
- ur gonna notice ur hp starts dropping a lot here, maintain it with brew/blubber. don't eat too high cos ur gonna adapt ur last clones HP soon anyway.
- 4tick it down with basics (g conc/db/gchain/gconc) 
Tip 3 (part 2):
then
- take over your last clone, immediately reflect with defender + eat to full
- if your adren is 70%+, try to get to 100% and do a time skip > sunshine between kerapac and last clone
- if you get the skip+sun then do 2 abilities > limitless + devotion > wild magic > wild magic again > gconc > db
- devotion when your first one runs out, get the extension off the clone if it's still alive, then fight kerapac
- if you didnt get skip+sun cos adren too low, fuck the sun, do a bunch of damage to the clone, then timeskip + devotion 
- try to finish the minion on that devotion to get the extend, if not just reapply devotion after the timeskip and get your extension off that one

then
- for kerapac, 3-4 key abilities: debilitate + reflect + preparation + resonance
- i like to use some big abilities while my devotion is still up, then right after devotion i do spellbook swap + disrup shield
- then debilitate and keep dpsing
- grab a resonance on soul split after debilitate ends, then preparation to get resonance back faster
- then defender + reflect. By the time reflect runs out, debilitate should be back up
- by the time debilitate runs out, resonance should be back up
- by the time you've lost HP again, you should be close to timeskip devotion again

i normally only need 1 debilitate and 1 resonance, but i do a shit load of soul split flicking which helps 
Random tips:

- i like to try and keep him in 1 place during jumps incase Wen book procs, except for jump 3 when i prioritise Combust instead (cant do it earlier as sun is up)
- there's about 3-4 different lightening patterns to get used to. Typically you can always eliminate 2 with a bd+surge, then surge the last one. sometimes you can get all 3 with 1 BD+surge
- always vuln bomb + smoke cloud during the end of p1/2, before time skip
- the end of p2, you wanna activate timeskip + sun much earlier than the end of p1, allowing you to get the full 4-hit asphyx in the timeskip (instead of 3 + move). Timed perfectly, you can even get a gconc+wild magic as you run under him (i did it in the vid) 
- play with voiceover sounds on, sun + vuln bomb + target cycle when he says 'you' at the start for perfect start everytime
- generally every sunshine should include:

- wild magic (in skip)
- asphyx (in skip)
- wild magic
- asphyx
- 4t deto+dbreath
- gstaff
- 60% omnipower

sun should be ending 4-5sec after the omnipower, and omnipower should be happening around the start of jumps.
make sure you run back in your sun afte ra jump if it still has 4-5 seconds left.

When you say in the vid i dont take much dmg p4...
I have a small EnhDev4 carry
it procs:
first clone
second clone
third clone (right as i skip+sun, which hleps a lot)
third clone again
third clone again (b2b) though both of these are irrelevent cos im in skip, so HP doesnt matter as it'll revert back to full anyway
third clone again (as i come out of skip), irrelevent cos im in devotion
kerapac, but irrelevent cos im in devotion
kerapac while im at 40% hp, which is huge cos i will heal myself back to 60% before i take dmg again

so during p4, i get:
- 20 seconds of irrelevent damage (cos im in timeskip, so i heal anyway)
- about 2k hp of free healing when i take over my last clone
- about 13-14 seconds of relevent devotion
- 1 disruption shield, which is huge cos he attacks every 2.4 seconds, so if you time it right you get around 4 seconds of free soul split
- 8 seconds of deblitate, though in the vid i only get 7 because i used it inbetween his attacks, rather than right as one landed<p>
